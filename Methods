THe paired-end (PE) RNAseq was performed using Illumina Hiseq platform. PE reads were assessed using fastQC (Andres, 2010) and reports were generated using multiQC (Ewels et al., 2016). Trimming was performed using Trim_Galore prior to the alignment to the reference genome (Genebank ACCS: 	GCA_015237465.2 rCheMyd1.pri.v2). Alignment was performed using STAR aligner (v2.7.10a) (Dobin, 2013). The gene count matrices were generated with HTSeq-count (Anders, 2015). Suseqeunt differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2(Love, 2014). 
Genes were considered siginificant if the Bonferroni adjusted p-value is less than 0.05 and passes the fold change cutoff of 2 (log2fold change = 0.58). Figures were generated using the R package ggplot2. 
Gene ontology enrichment was performed using `goseq` - an R package (Young et al., 2010). The cutoff of 0.05 for over/under represented p-value was used to determine the GO term enrichment.
